This is officially and educational project to teach new developers to eZ Publish Development Concepts using "eZ Publish Basic" (This PHP CMS) to provide a simple starter solution for a basic PHP - Personal Home Page based CMS.

## About (Original)

Originally called eZ Publish Version 2 and published by eZ Systems (now called Ibexa) in 1999.

In mid 2001 7x started development on the basis of eZ Community 2.x PHP/MySQL CMS based on eZ Publish 2.2.x

Released in part as eZ Community 2.3 around 2006 it was the basis of what is possible today. It was released as a work in progress and incomplete with stability features to refine it's general cms implementation and e-commerce implementation for USA based users.

This is the primary repository (It was based on a subtree split of the deprecated ezcommunity2-contributions repository. Created for simpler maintenance and support)
