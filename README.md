## About (Original)

Originally released as **eZ Publish Version 2** by eZ Systems (now Ibexa) in 1999, this CMS has a storied history of innovation.

In mid-2001, **7x** began development based on **eZ Community 2.x**, a PHP/MySQL CMS derived from eZ Publish 2.2.x.

### Notable Milestones:
- Released in part as **eZ Community 2.3** around 2006.
- Enhanced stability and refined CMS/e-commerce features for USA-based users.
- This repository is a direct descendant of the deprecated `ezcommunity2-contributions` repository, restructured for simpler maintenance and support.
