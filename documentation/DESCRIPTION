Based on PHP, the leading programming language module for the Apache
web server software, eZ publish draws on the speed from this renown
software. The backend database is MySQL which is fast and reliable,
proven on thousands of Internet sites.

Further speed enhancements are made in the eZ publish by using caching
of data and reduced connections to the database.

All the default templates delivered with eZ publish are tested on a
diverse mix of browsers, Opera, Internet Explorer, Netscape, Konqueror
and Lynx, thus enabling all users to gain access to your site.

So called cookie-less sessions are supported, a method used to enable
user recognition even for those who objects to use cookies, no-one will
feel left out or overseen.

eZ publish keeps track of the statistics of your site. How many
visitors, from where, what do they buy and what are they looking at.

The package has been translated to several languages, you can even
translate it yourself through the eZ Babel software we've developed
for this purpose specifically.

Changing the design of your site is easy because of separation of
content and design. You don't have to know anything about PHP or coding,
just something about HTML.

For those proficient in programming PHP the source code is available,
it can be used as a basis for adding new modules and functionality
tailored to your specific needs.

The target audience for eZ publish are e-commerce, ASP (Application
Service Providers), BSP (Business Service Providers), news publishing,
