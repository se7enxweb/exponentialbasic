1 What is eZ publish 2?
1.1 One Line Description

eZ publish 2 is a content management system for e-commerce, e-publishing and intranets.



1.2 Short Description

eZ publish 2 is a web based application suite. It delivers functionality
ranging from publishing of news, web logs and diaries, through web shop
functionality like shopping carts and wishlists and forums to intranet
functions like contact handling and bug reporting.

a user database and both cookie-based and non-cookie sessions.

It supports statistics for page views, links followed and banner ads, both
images and HTML with presentation logic.

The package lends itself easily to customization, from changing the look
and feel by changing templates, localizing the languages and other
internationalization issues to adding new functionality.

The target audience for eZ publish 2 are e-commerce, ASP (Application Service
Providers), BSP (Business Service Providers), news publishing, intranets,
bug reporting, content management, discussion boards, FAQ and knowledge
handling, file and image management, group ware, calendaring, polls, todo

eZ publish 2 extensively. Read that for more info, then visit the eZ Community
site:

2 If the Software Fails to Work at All

You should always make sure that you've followed the INSTALL text file in
this distribution, and that you've downloaded the configuration manual and
configured the software accordingly. 



3. Error Messages
3.1 Database is Missing

Are you sure that you configured site.ini to point to your database? Did
you provide a correct user name and password? Did you follow the INSTALL
file and the information about installing the database?



3.2 Missing Functions
3.2.1 "qdom_tree()"

You've failed to install the QT package properly, please visit
http://www.trolltech.com and read how you should install QT.

A common problem is that you might have several versions of QT
installed.



3.2.2 "xmltree()"

You've failed to install the libXml2 package properly, please visit
the site http://xmlsoft.org/#Downloads



4. Problems Logging In
4.1 How Do I Log In as Administrator?

To log in as administrator you have to point your browser to your admin
site, probably called something like http://admin.yoursite.com, if you
followed the installation instructions. On the login screen you can login
as "admin" and with the password "publish".



4.2 Forgot Password Doesn't Work For Admin

You probably failed to change the default e-mail address of the
administrator, and thus you don't get the e-mails. Use this SQL to cahnge
the password of the administrator user through the mysql client:

    INSERT INTO eZUser_User SET Password=PASSWORD('publish') WHERE Login='admin';

5. Misc questions

5.1 Can't upload big files

You must configure php to handle files bigger than 2MB.


5.2 ' and " appear as \" and \', why?

eZ publish 2.1 and newer must have magick quotes disabled to work propperly. eZ publish 2 
handles the escaping of characters by itself.
