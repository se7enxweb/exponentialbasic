eZSurvey README

Based on the work of jimmerman@users.sourceforge.net on phpESP (http://phpesp.sourceforge.net/),
eZ Survey is an eZ Publish module capable of managing several surveys....

* Surveys can have several types of questions: Yes/Box, Text Box, Text Area, Radio/Check Buttons, 
Select box, Date, Numeric, etc (you can easily add new types though)

* Questions can have default values

* Preview/Copy of Surveys

* Intuitive backoffice interface

* Can have several pages

* Can receive responses by e-mail

* Has Statistics

(as a note i just want to say that i've just inspired myself in the work of jimmerman on phpESP, 
i didn't even look at his code and has just used his idea and database to make up this module.)
